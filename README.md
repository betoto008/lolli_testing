# lolli_testing
This repository contains the code used to simulate an epidemiological scenario where the Lolli-testing method is used. 

The Python code is a modified version of the publicly available SEIRS+ code at https://github.com/ryansmcgee/seirsplus. We thank the Ryan Seamus McGee (ryansmcgee) for making this code available.
